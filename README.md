# Operating Systems 2016
This repository contains two assignments for the Operating Systems (2016) University course.

## Assignment 1
Developed a minimal shell in C that has the following features:
- It reads the name of a program from the keyboard and if the program exists in any directory inside the
`$PATH` variable, it executes it.
- It supports multiple parameters
- It provides an `exit` and a `cd` command that supports both absolute and relative paths as arguments.
- It supports multiple pipes using the `|` character.

## Assignment 2
Performed **process synchronization** using **semaphores** and also **thread synchronization** using pthreads
API's **mutexes** and **condition variables** in C in order to avoid **race conditions** when two or more
**processes** or **threads** are using the same resource respectively.
